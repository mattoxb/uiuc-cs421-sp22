There are many benefits to study programming languages.  Here are some that might be convincing
to you.

*** Gain the ability to implement a language.

Before taking this course you are most likely a *consumer* of programming languages.  You may have opinions about which
ones you like best, but your options are restricted to languages that already exist.  After this course, you will be
able to design and implement a language for yourself.  Maybe you're thinking, "Why would I need to do that?"  One reason
this happens is that the developers of a software product decide they want to enable their users to write scripts to
control it.  There are languages like Lua you could use, but they might not be a good fit.

*** Document your language and understand language documentation

A good part of this course covers an area called *semantics*, or the meaning of languages.  Being able to write a formal
specification of your language means that if multiple teams decide to implement it, their implementations will all do
the same thing.  (At least, there's a chance that could happen!)  Being able to read a formal specification of a
language means you will understand precisely how a feature works.

You can also use formal semantics of languages to do things like verify the correctness of a program in certain
situations.  (The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem][halting problem]] means we'll can't hope to do it in all cases.)

*** See the variety of languages specialized for certain tasks

Most of the languages you will have learned to this point are general purpose languages.  And most of them are
imperative (command based) languages with objects and classes as a major component.  In this class you will learn other
language paradigms such as functional (Haskell and Scheme), logic (Prolog), and stack-based (Forth).  Functional
languages allow very reliable and very concise programs.  Prolog can solve your type-inferencer MP in about 15 minutes,
instead of the week we are going to give you to implement it in Haskell.  Languages like Forth are well suited for
embedded systems.  Scheme has a language construct that allows you to *program the programming language* itself.

You can live a long and happy programmer's life only knowing Python or Javascript, but then you would never even be
aware of some of the other options you have.

*** Learning Modules and Outcomes

- There are 20 learning modules in the course, each themed around a specific course topic.
- Each learning module has 10 points that we distribute among one or more /outcomes/.
- Each outcome has one or more assessments that will "fulfill" it if completed.
- To fulfill a learning module you must complete enough outcomes to have 10 points in the learning module.
  - Most learning modules will have exactly 10 points, but it is possible for there to be more than 10.
    In those cases, you still only need to get 10 points.
- You cannot partially complete a learning module.

*** Assessments

There are four kinds of assessments you will see.

- Machine problems (MPs) :: These are long programming assignments.  The threshold for passing them is 95%.
  - Before the MP is due you can get full credit on it.
  - There is a one-week extension period in which you can only get 95%. Thus, you must fully complete the MP for it to
    count.
- Exam Questions :: Most exam questions involve coding or some kind of mathematical manipulation (like lambda calculus reductions).
  - The threshold for passing an exam question is 100%, except for proof trees.  These are passing at 95%.
  - If you don't get an exam question right, you will have another attempt on the following midterm (if there is one).
  - You will also get an attempt on the final exam.
  - An exam question usually will affect only a single outcome.  If you miss an exam question you only need to focus on the outcomes
    you missed, not the whole learning module.
- Activity Questions ::
  - Activities are primarily designed for you to practice the assessments you will see on an exam.
  - An activity /may/ contribute to some of the outcomes of a learning module, but not always.
  - We use the score for the whole activity, not the individual questions within it.
- In-Class POGIL Activities ::
  - These are graded based on participation. Signing into a POGIL group on PrairieLearn during the class period (for
    live section) or during the next five days (for asynchronous students) will be called "attendance".
  - In order to get an A in the class, you must attend (or be excused from) 80% of the group activities.

*** Assignments and Grading

# Cite Nilson2015 at some point here.

This course will use *mastery grading*.  The grade for this course will not be determined by total number of points, but
by completing a required number of *learning modules*, and a required number of *machine problems*.

**** Learning Modules

A learning module is a bundle of *learning outcomes* (skills you should acquire) along with assessments
that measure these skills.

  - Each learning module will typically contain four or five assessments.
  - Each assessment is graded pass/fail.  You must get full credit on an assessment to pass it, but...
  - You will have **multiple opportunities** to complete each assessment.
  - To complete a learning module, you must pass all of the underlying learning outcomes.

**** Machine Problems

Typically there will be about six machine problems, called *machine problems* (MPs). We will release one approximately
every two weeks. You are allowed to get help on the machine problems, but you need to cite your help.


**** In-class Activities

This class is an active learning / flipped lecture class.  The intent is that you will watch a "pre-lecture video"
before class, and then during class you will participate in a team activity.  These activities are
[[https://pogil.org][POGIL]] activities.

Attendance and participation in the team activities are required.  Please see [[/docs/getting-started/remote-students][these instructions]] if you want to take the class remotely or as a Chicago City Scholars
student.

In order to get an A in the class, you must attend (or be excused from) 80% of the team activities.

**** Web Assignments

In addition to the written part that is done in class, there is an online part that tests the concepts you learned in
class.  You are allowed as many attempts as you need to solve the problems, and most activities will fulfill part of the
associated learning module.  You will have one week to complete them.

**** Exams

There will be three midterm exams and one final exam.  The exams do not confer points, but each problem on the exam will
fulfill part of a mastery area.  Each of these mastery area components will appear again on the final exam, which gives
you a "second chance" if you need it:  If you have already gotten credit for an area,  you may ignore it on the final
exam without penalty.  If you did not get credit on an area from taking the midterm, you can still get credit by doing
that problem on the final.  This also means that the entire final exam is optional if you have already obtained the
grade you want.

One week before an exam, we will provide a practice exam that follows the same format for your studying pleasure.

This course uses the college of engineering [[http://edu.cs.illinois.edu/cbtf][computer-based testing facility]] (CBTF)
for its exams.  The policies of the CBTF are the policies of this course, and academic integrity infractions related to
the CBTF are infractions in this course.

If you have accommodations identified by the division of rehabilitation-education services (DRES) for exams, please take
your letter of accommodation (LOA) to the CBTF proctors in person before you make your first exam reservation. The
proctors will advise you as to whether the CBTF provides your accommodations or whether you will need to make other
arrangements with your instructor.

Any problem with testing in the CBTF must be reported to CBTF staff at the time the problem occurs. **If you do not
inform a proctor of a problem during the test then you forfeit all rights to redress.**

**** 4th Hour Project

If you are a graduate student taking the course for 4 hours, then you need to complete [[/docs/project/][a project]]. The
project does not confer a grade, but if you do not do a satisfactory job on it you will lose a letter grade.

**** Late Policy / Missing Exams

Late submissions are built into PrairieLearn.  For machine problems, you will have one week to turn it it for 95%
credit.  (This would be enough to fulfull the turn-in and LM requirements, but you would need full credit.)

**** Code Efficiency

Unless stated otherwise, you should assume that code that does not compile, or code that is inefficient (in terms of
time and space complexity), will not earn any points.  **We will not hand grade non-compiling code**.

***** Regrade Requests

If there is an error in the grading of an assignment, please file an issue request on [[/docs/getting-started/github][your github repository]]. Please
assign the tag "regrade" and assign the issue to the instructor.

Once grades are released, you have *one week* to file any regrade requests.

*** Grade Cutoffs

We will determine your grade based on how many of the 20 learning modules and 6 MPs you complete, and also attendance.

 | Grade | Learning Modules | MPs | Attendance |
 |-------+------------------+-----+------------|
 | A     |               18 |   5 | >=80%      |
 | B     |               16 |   4 | <80%       |
 | C     |               14 |   3 |            |
 | D     |               10 |   2 |            |


If you complete more MPs than are required for your grade, or enough learning modules for the next higher grade, we will
give you a + grade.  E.g., if you did 16 learning modules but all 6 MPs, you would get a B+.  Similarly if you completed 18
learning modules but only 4 MPs.

To get an A+, you must complete all 20 learning modules and all 6 MPs.

As explained above, 4 credit hour students must also complete the project or else lose a letter grade.

Undergraduates are encouraged to do the extra project as well.  It will not affect your grade, but it will give me something
to say if you happen to want a letter of recommendation later.

*** Academic Integrity

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign student code should also be considered as a part of this syllabus.
Students should pay particular attention to Article 1, Part 4: Academic Integrity. Academic dishonesty may result in a
failing grade. Every student is expected to review and abide by the [[[http://studentcode.illinois.edu/][academic integrity policy]].  Ignorance is not an excuse for any academic dishonesty. it is your
responsibility to read this policy to avoid any misunderstanding. Do not hesitate to ask the instructor(s) if you are
ever in doubt about what constitutes plagiarism, cheating, or any other breach of academic integrity.

*** Students with Disabilities

To obtain disability-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary aids,
students with disabilities must contact the course instructor as soon as
possible. To insure that disability-related concerns are properly
addressed from the beginning, students with disabilities who require
assistance to participate in this class should contact disability
resources and educational services
([[http://www.disability.illinois.edu/][DRES]]) and see the instructor
as soon as possible. If you need accommodations for any sort of
disability, please speak to me after class, or make an appointment to
see me, or see me during my office hours. DRES provides students with
academic accommodations, access, and support services. To contact DRES
you may visit 1207 S. Oak St., Champaign, call 333-4603 (v/tdd), or
e-mail a message to [[mailto:disability@uiuc.edu][disability@uiuc.edu]].

*** Emergency Response Recommendations

The university police have posted some [[http://police.illinois.edu/emergency/][emergency response recommendations]]. I
encourage you to review this website and the campus building
[[http://police.illinois.edu/emergency-preparedness/building-emergency-action-plans/][floor plans website]]
within the first 10 days of class.

Of course, since we're all online, your classroom is likely your living space.  Have you considered making
a fire safety plan with your family or roommates?

*** Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)


Any student who has suppressed their directory information pursuant to family
educational rights and privacy act (FERPA) should self-identify to the
instructor to ensure protection of the privacy of their attendance in this
course. see the [[http://registrar.illinois.edu/ferpa][FERPA]] site for more information.

*** Mental Health

Diminished mental health, including significant stress, mood changes, excessive worry, substance/alcohol abuse, or
problems with eating and/or sleeping can interfere with optimal academic performance, social development, and emotional
wellbeing. The University of Illinois offers a variety of confidential services including individual and group
counseling, crisis intervention, psychiatric services, and specialized screenings at no additional cost. If you or
someone you know experiences any of the above mental health concerns, it is strongly encouraged to contact or visit any
of the University's resources provided below.  Getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do -- for yourself and
for those who care about you.

Need a parser but don't have a lot of time?  Maybe a recursive-descent parser
will do the trick.  LL parsers are simple, easy to write, and sometimes they even work
with the language you had in mind!

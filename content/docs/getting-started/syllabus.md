## Official Description and Learning Goals

The instructor's course goals are on the homepage, but here's the
university description of the course:

>  structure of programming languages and their implementation. basic
>  language design principles; abstract data types; functional languages;
>  type systems; object-oriented languages. basics of lexing, parsing,
>  syntax-directed translation, semantic analysis, and code generation.
>
>  course information: 3 undergraduate hours. 3 or 4 graduate hours.
>
>  prerequisite: cs 233 and cs 374.

Here are the official learning goals:

>  - learn to program in a functional programming language
>  - understand the evaluation of programs in a functional programming
>    language
>  - be able to write a type checker / type inferencer given a formal
>    type system
>  - be able to write a lexer, and a parser using recursive-descent
>    parsing.
>  - program translation: be able to write a syntax-directed translator
>    from abstract syntax to intermediate representations
>  - recognize and use major methods of specification of dynamic
>    semantics
>  - write a interpreter based on a formal operational semantics of the
>    language

## Assignments and Grading

This course will use *mastery grading* ([Nilson2015](../references#Nilson2015)).
The grade for this course will not be determined by total number of points, but by completing
a required number of *learning modules*, and a required number of *machine problems*.

### Learning Modules

A learning module is a bundle of *learning outcomes* (skills you should acquire) along with assessments
that measure these skills.

  - Each learning module will typically contain four or five assessments.
  - Each assessment is graded pass/fail.  You must get full credit on an assessment to pass it, but...
  - You will have **multiple opportunities** to complete each assessment.
  - To complete a learning module, you must pass all of the underlying learning outcomes.

### Machine Problems

Typically there will be about six machine problems, called *machine problems*
(MPs). We will release one approximately every two weeks. You are allowed to get
help on the machine problems, but you need to cite your help.


### In-class Activities

This class is an active learning / flipped lecture class.  The intent is that
you will watch a "pre-lecture video" before class, and then during class you
will participate in a team activity.  These activities are
[POGIL](https://pogil.org) activities.

Attendance and participation in the team activities are required.  If you wish
to take the class remotely you will need to make arrangements with the instructor.

<!-- The Student Code allows for [certain kind of absences](http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part5/1-501/)
to be excused as well. -->

### Web Assignments

In addition to the written part that is done in class, there is an online part
that tests the concepts you learned in class.  You are allowed as many attempts as you need
to solve the problems, and most activities will fulfill part of the associated learning module.
You will have one week to complete them.

### Exams

There will be three midterm exams and one final exam.  The exams do not confer points,
but each problem on the exam will fulfill part of a mastery area.  Each of these mastery
area components will appear again on the final exam, which gives you a "second chance"
if you need it:  If you have already gotten credit for an area,  you may ignore it on the
final exam without penalty.  If you did not get credit on an area from taking the midterm,
you can still get credit by doing that problem on the final.  This also means that the
entire final exam is optional if you have already obtained the grade you want.

One week before an exam, we will provide a practice exam that follows the same format for your
studying pleasure.

This course uses the college of engineering [computer-based testing
facility](http://edu.cs.illinois.edu/cbtf) (CBTF) for its exams.  The policies
of the CBTF are the policies of this course, and academic integrity infractions
related to the CBTF are infractions in this course.

If you have accommodations identified by the division of
rehabilitation-education services (DRES) for exams, please take your letter of
accommodation (LOA) to the CBTF proctors in person before you make your first
exam reservation. The proctors will advise you as to whether the CBTF provides
your accommodations or whether you will need to make other arrangements with
your instructor.

Any problem with testing in the CBTF must be reported to CBTF staff at the time
the problem occurs. **If you do not inform a proctor of a problem during the
test then you forfeit all rights to redress.**

### 4th Hour Project

If you are a graduate student taking the course for 4 hours, then you need to
complete [a project](/docs/project/). The project does not confer a grade, but
if you do not do a satisfactory job on it you will lose a letter grade.

### Late Policy / Missing Exams

Late submissions are built into PrairieLearn.  For machine problems, you will
have one week to turn it it for 80% credit.  For activities, you will have until
the end of the semester, also for 80% credit.

### Code Efficiency

Unless stated otherwise, you should assume that code that does not
compile, or code that is inefficient (in terms of time and space
complexity), will not earn any points.  **We will not hand grade non-compiling code**.

#### Regrade Requests

If there is an error in the grading of an assignment, please file an
issue request on [your github repository]({{< ref "/docs/getting-started/github" >}}). Please
assign the tag "regrade" and assign the issue to the instructor.

Once grades are released, you have *one week* to file any regrade
requests.

## Grade Cutoffs

We will determine your grade based on how many of the 20 learning modules and 6 MPs
you complete.

 | Grade | Learning Modules | MPs |
 | ----- | ---------------- | --- |
 | A     | 18               | 6   |
 | B     | 16               | 5   |
 | C     | 14               | 4   |
 | D     | 10               | 3   |

 
If you complete more MPs than are required for your grade, or enough learning modules for the next higher grade, we will
give you a + grade.  E.g., if you did 16 learning modules but all 6 MPs, you would get a B+.  Similarly if you completed 18
learning modules but only 5 MPs.
 
To get an A+, you must complete all 20 learning modules and all 6 MPs.

As explained above, 4 credit hour students must also complete the project or else lose a letter grade.

Undergraduates are encouraged to do the extra project as well.  It will not affect your grade, but it will give me something
to say if you happen to want a letter of recommendation later.

## Academic Integrity

The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign student code should also be
considered as a part of this syllabus. Students should pay particular attention
to Article 1, Part 4: Academic Integrity. Academic dishonesty may result in a
failing grade. Every student is expected to review and abide by the [academic integrity policy]([http://studentcode.illinois.edu/). 
Ignorance is not an excuse for any academic dishonesty. it is
your responsibility to read this policy to avoid any misunderstanding. Do not
hesitate to ask the instructor(s) if you are ever in doubt about what
constitutes plagiarism, cheating, or any other breach of academic integrity.

## Students with Disabilities

To obtain disability-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary aids,
students with disabilities must contact the course instructor as soon as
possible. To insure that disability-related concerns are properly
addressed from the beginning, students with disabilities who require
assistance to participate in this class should contact disability
resources and educational services
([DRES](http://www.disability.illinois.edu/)) and see the instructor
as soon as possible. If you need accommodations for any sort of
disability, please speak to me after class, or make an appointment to
see me, or see me during my office hours. DRES provides students with
academic accommodations, access, and support services. To contact DRES
you may visit 1207 S. Oak St., Champaign, call 333-4603 (v/tdd), or
e-mail a message to [disability@uiuc.edu](mailto:disability@uiuc.edu).

## Emergency Response Recommendations

The university police have posted some [emergency response recommendations](http://police.illinois.edu/emergency/). I
encourage you to review this website and the campus building 
[floor plans website](http://police.illinois.edu/emergency-preparedness/building-emergency-action-plans/)
within the first 10 days of class.

Of course, since we're all online, your classroom is likely your living space.  Have you considered making
a fire safety plan with your family or roommates?

## Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)


Any student who has suppressed their directory information pursuant to family
educational rights and privacy act (FERPA) should self-identify to the
instructor to ensure protection of the privacy of their attendance in this
course. see the [FERPA](http://registrar.illinois.edu/ferpa) site for more information.

## Mental Health

Diminished mental health, including significant stress, mood changes, excessive
worry, substance/alcohol abuse, or problems with eating and/or sleeping can
interfere with optimal academic performance, social development, and emotional
wellbeing. The University of Illinois offers a variety of confidential services
including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, psychiatric
services, and specialized screenings at no additional cost. If you or someone
you know experiences any of the above mental health concerns, it is strongly
encouraged to contact or visit any of the University’s resources provided below.
Getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do -- for yourself and for those
who care about you.

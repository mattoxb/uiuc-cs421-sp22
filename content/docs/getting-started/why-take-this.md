There are many benefits to study programming languages.  Here are some that might be convincing
to you.


## Gain the ability to implement a language. {#gain-the-ability-to-implement-a-language-dot}

Before taking this course you are most likely a **consumer** of programming languages.  You may have opinions about which
ones you like best, but your options are restricted to languages that already exist.  After this course, you will be
able to design and implement a language for yourself.  Maybe you're thinking, "Why would I need to do that?"  One reason
this happens is that the developers of a software product decide they want to enable their users to write scripts to
control it.  There are languages like Lua you could use, but they might not be a good fit.


## Document your language and understand language documentation {#document-your-language-and-understand-language-documentation}

A good part of this course covers an area called **semantics**, or the meaning of languages.  Being able to write a formal
specification of your language means that if multiple teams decide to implement it, their implementations will all do
the same thing.  (At least, there's a chance that could happen!)  Being able to read a formal specification of a
language means you will understand precisely how a feature works.

You can also use formal semantics of languages to do things like verify the correctness of a program in certain
situations.  (The [halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem) means we'll can't hope to do it in all cases.)


## See the variety of languages specialized for certain tasks {#see-the-variety-of-languages-specialized-for-certain-tasks}

Most of the languages you will have learned to this point are general purpose languages.  And most of them are
imperative (command based) languages with objects and classes as a major component.  In this class you will learn other
language paradigms such as functional (Haskell and Scheme), logic (Prolog), and stack-based (Forth).  Functional
languages allow very reliable and very concise programs.  Prolog can solve your type-inferencer MP in about 15 minutes,
instead of the week we are going to give you to implement it in Haskell.  Languages like Forth are well suited for
embedded systems.  Scheme has a language construct that allows you to **program the programming language** itself.

You can live a long and happy programmer's life only knowing Python or Javascript, but then you would never even be
aware of some of the other options you have.

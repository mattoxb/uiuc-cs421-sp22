We do not encourage taking this class as a remote student, but due to time
conflicts with other required courses or due to an annoying amount of uncertainty
regarding the ongoing Covid pandemic we will allow for this.  There is also the
Chicago Scholars program.

Here's what you need to do.

## Time Conflict or Covid Concerns

- In lieu of in-class activities, we will form groups of remote students to complete
  activities together online, via Prairielearn.
- You can assume you are approved to take the class remotely, but you need to sign up
  [[https://forms.gle/sgVjjYVXmvFadN1V9][with this Google form]].
  This is mainly so we have a list of who is doing so, and so we have you
  on record as agreeing to participate online with other students.

## Chicago City Scholars Students

You are kind of remote, kind of not remote.  We may need to adjust this to allow
for scheduling changes or Covid changes, but for now the students in the Chicago
City Scholars program will follow the in-person protocol, modified to account
for there being one instructor visit per week.

We already have a list of who is in this program, so there is no need to send an
email.

We do not encourage taking this class as a remote student, but due to time
conflicts with other required courses or due to an annoying amount of uncertainty
regarding the ongoing Covid pandemic we will allow for this.

- You **must** get explicit approval from the instructor to take the class as a remote
  student.  This is mainly so we have a list of who is doing so.
- In lieu of in-class activities, we will form groups of remote students to complete
  activities together online, via Prairielearn.
- Students in the Chicago City Scholars program will follow the in-person protocol,
  modified to account for there being one instructor visit per week.

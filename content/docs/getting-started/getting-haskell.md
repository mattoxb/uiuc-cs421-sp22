## Getting Haskell

In order to use Haskell on your own machine, you need to install a program called
`stack`.  This is the package manager and build system for Haskell, similar to
`npm` for Node and `maven` for Java.

You can install `stack` from [the official website](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/blob/master/doc/install_and_upgrade.md)
but there is an installer called `GHCup` that will automate a lot of this for you.

You can get `GHCup` [here](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/).  You should install
`stack`, `ghc`, `cabal`, and `HLS` (this will connect to your editor and make
things easier.

If you are on Linux, you might also be able to do this with your package manager.


## Configuring Your Editor

Your editor is the most important tool you will use on a computer.  Mastering a good editor
can make a world of difference in your productivity as a programmer.

If you like vscode, this blog post is helpful.

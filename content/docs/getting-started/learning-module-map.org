Here is a listing of the learning modules and the assignments that fulfill them.
We will update this whenever we release a new assignment.  Each LM has 10 points to it;
some assignments give more points than others, and some LMs have more that 10 points of opportunity
(so you could miss something and sill have other opportunities).

If two assignments are listed with a + between them then both are necessary to
fulfill the objective.   If they are comma separated then you will have a choice.

Second chance exams are not listed.  Exam 2 will "second chance" Exam 1, Exam 3 will
"second chance" Exam 2, and the Final will second chance all three midterms.

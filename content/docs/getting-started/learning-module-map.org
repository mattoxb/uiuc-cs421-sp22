Here is a listing of the learning modules and the assignments that fulfill them.
We will update this whenever we release a new assignment.

If two assignments are listed with a + between them then both are necessary to
fulfill the objective.   If they are comma separated then you will have a choice.

Second chance exams are not listed.  Exam 2 will "second chance" Exam 1, Exam 3 will
"second chance" Exam 2, and the Final will second chance all three midterms.

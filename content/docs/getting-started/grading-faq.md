## Learning Modules and Outcomes {#learning-modules-and-outcomes}

-   There are 20 learning modules in the course, each themed around a specific course topic.
-   Each learning module has 10 points that we distribute among one or more _outcomes_.
-   Each outcome has one or more assessments that will "fulfill" it if completed.
-   To fulfill a learning module you must complete enough outcomes to have 10 points in the learning module.
    -   Most learning modules will have exactly 10 points, but it is possible for there to be more than 10.
        In those cases, you still only need to get 10 points.
-   You cannot partially complete a learning module.


## Assessments {#assessments}

There are four kinds of assessments you will see.

Machine problems (MPs)
: These are long programming assignments.  The threshold for passing them is 95%.
    -   Before the MP is due you can get full credit on it.
    -   There is a one-week extension period in which you can only get 95%. Thus, you must fully complete the MP for it to
        count.

Exam Questions
: Most exam questions involve coding or some kind of mathematical manipulation (like lambda calculus reductions).
    -   The threshold for passing an exam question is 100%, except for proof trees.  These are passing at 95%.
    -   If you don't get an exam question right, you will have another attempt on the following midterm (if there is one).
    -   You will also get an attempt on the final exam.
    -   An exam question usually will affect only a single outcome.  If you miss an exam question you only need to focus on the outcomes
        you missed, not the whole learning module.

Activity Questions
: -   Activities are primarily designed for you to practice the assessments you will see on an exam.
    -   An activity _may_ contribute to some of the outcomes of a learning module, but not always.
    -   We use the score for the whole activity, not the individual questions within it.

In-Class POGIL Activities
: -   These are graded based on participation. Signing into a POGIL group on PrairieLearn during the class period (for
        live section) or during the next five days (for asynchronous students) will be called "attendance".
    -   In order to get an A in the class, you must attend (or be excused from) 80% of the group activities.

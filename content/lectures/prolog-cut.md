## Synopsis

One problem with <Sc>Prolog</Sc> is that it can try too many things to satisfy a
set of constraints.  The Cut Operator eliminates some of the search
possibilities by committing a search to whatever decisions have already been
made.  It can also prevent the destruction of innocent telescopes.

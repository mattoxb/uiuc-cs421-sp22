LR parsers have been the industry standard for quite some time.  The gnu C compiler
even comes with an LR parser generator (called \`bison\`, a take-off of an older utility
called \`yacc\`.  Computer people like puns.).  These parsers are fast and capable, but
to be effective using them you really need to understand how they work.

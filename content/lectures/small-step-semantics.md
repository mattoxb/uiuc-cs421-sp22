## Synopsis


Today we will talk about *small-step semantics*, also called *transition
semantics*, or even *operational semantics*. The idea with this semantics is
that we model what one step of computation looks like, and use that to describe
the meaning of a program.

One important concept that comes up with this form is the *Church-Rosser theorem*.

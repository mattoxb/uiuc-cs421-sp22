Today we will talk about **small-step semantics**, also called **transition
semantics**, or even **operational semantics**. The idea with this semantics is
that we model what one step of computation looks like, and use that to describe
the meaning of a program.

One important concept that comes up with this form is the **Church-Rosser theorem**.

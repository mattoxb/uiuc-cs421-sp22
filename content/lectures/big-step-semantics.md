## Synopsis

In order to be rigorous in our understanding of programming languages, it helps to be
able to state precisely the meaning of a program.  The branch of mathematics dealing
with this is called *semantics*.  There are many kinds of semantics.

This is our first lecture on semantics.
We will cover several forms of semantics
in the later part of the course, but this particular kind
happens to be very good at explaining what, precisely,
we are asking you to do when coding an interpreter for a
machine problem.

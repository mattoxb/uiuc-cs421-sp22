## Synopsis

Lambda calculus is one of several mathematical descriptions of computation.
It is extremely important in programming language research, as it is small (making
proofs about things written in it easier to write) and complete (meaning that
the results are actually applicable to "real" languages).

The notation may take a bit of getting used to, but you have already used everything
in it.

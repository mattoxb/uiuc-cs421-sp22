## Synopsis

This is the first of a two part series on typing semantics.  Semantics can do
more than just discovering the value of a program or expression; we can use
semantics to describe other properties of programs as well.  In this case,
we are interested in the types that expressions can have.

In this lecture we will discuss *monotype* semantics; where expressions can
have only one ground type.
